# GymBuddy Alpha Release
Usage Instructions:
Usage is simple and straight forward, the starting page consists of three tabs titled 'Logs, Running, Workouts'
The Logs tab is designed to keep log histories of all recent diet and workout plans for reference. Clicking a 
diet or workout button will take the user to the respective history page where logs can be added using the button
marked with a plus on the bottom right corner. Clicking this button will take the user to an add log page, where 
text can be edited and saved or cancel will return to the history page without saving the log. Previously made logs
will be able to be edited or deleted but this functionality does not exist yet. The running tab will have information
about recent runs performed including date, time and distance. An option will exist to add information for a new run.
Once start is selected for a new run, the time, distance and steps of the run will be tracked and the stop button will
add the run to the running tab page. The workouts tab has links to different categories, each with lists of unique 
training routines and reccomendations. Links to youtube for visual tutorials will be available amongst these pages as
well.


Known Bugs:
Logs entered cannot yet be edited or deleted
Clicking on any of the workout sections within the workout tab (ie weight lifting) will all bring up the same page, 
the feature is mostly to show an example of the layouts at this point
Landscape layouts have not been created and state is not saved upon change in orientation yet
Youtube links and various tutorials/reccomendations are not input yet.
